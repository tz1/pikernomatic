============

Series of scripts (and maybe makefiles, etc) to make it easy to build
kernels for the raspi

QUICKSTART:  Builds for current raspian distribution kernel (some kernel
symbols may change).  Adds spi-dma, CAN for mcp2515, and Adafruilt PiTFT
(stmpe-ts built but doesn't work, nor the reset)

Just do ./getsource.sh and wait for the downloads to complete (several in
parallel).

The do ./setupget.sh which does some patching

Then do ./buildall.sh and check the raspibuild/buildout directory for
the replacements.

getsource.sh creates the build directory and fetches the archives

Meant to be executed only once.  Note the --depth has been reduced to 50
since the raspicam is recent.

To build for much older binaries, this might need to be increased.

setupget.sh patches the fetched source (also needed after an update)

update.sh will clean and reset the build trees then fetch any updates to
the archives.  (Note, this fails with fbtft, you need to remove the
object/temp files or manually reverse the symlink so it is at the root
of the build pointing into linux/drivers/video/fbtft).

buildall.sh will compile the kernel, modules, and extra modules
(spi-dma, CAN, etc.).

The result will be in raspibuild/buildout - a boot and a lib directory
which can be copied to/over the one on the pi.  You either have to rename
the kernel or add kernel=newkernl.img to "config.txt".  (note you can also
put the command line into config.txt as cmdline=).  After unpacking, you
might want to do "depmod -a <version>" where version is something like
"3.10.36+" to insure the reboot will be clean before depmod is run as part
of the bootup.

See the forums and product information for instructions of making CAN or
a TFT or other hardware work.  Additions to /etc/modules, /etc/modprobe.d,
and other userland programs are usually needed.

setvars.sh is called to set the paths, compilers, etc. and is called
from other scripts IT MUST BE EDITED IF YOU WISH TO SELECT A DIFFERENT
KERNEL.  If HASH is omitted, setupget will fetch the latest kernel.
Instructions for finding the correct hash are in comments at the top of
this file.

gethash.sh has instructions to help find the release and will get the
current binary firmware which might NOT be an official release or
update.  HASH-HOWTO is a more comprehensive guide to finding the hash in
a few minutes if you know where and how to look.

config is set for turning everything on or off.

a patch file is included which expands the number of interrupts.

Currently builds a set with small font console display (vga8x8),
Adafruit PiTFT, and CAN support.

NOTE: it might not work with all combinations, especially earlier (pre
2014) kernels.

For notro's fbtft for Adafruit's PiTFT, replace frequency with speed,
i.e. in /etc/options/fbtft.conf add: options fbtft_device name=pitft
rotate=90 speed=32000000 fps=24

LIMITATIONS

Most things try to change the kernel as little as possible so binary
modules against the stock kernel will work.

fbtft alters backlight support but most changes are confined to
drivers/video.

Also leaving a module that gets moved to the kernel (backlight.ko) can
break depmod.  

For now it is better to copy over the kernel and the lib/module/<ver>
tree, and add any extra binary modules from other sources.

TODO: deb packaging or other to make install easier add new kernel as
default to /boot/config.txt add in /etc/modprobe.d or other config to go
with the modules
