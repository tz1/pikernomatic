HASH-HOWTO

How to determine the git checkout hash for a release.

First, do "uname -a" on the Pi to get the kernel version string.  There will be a #nnn followed 
by "PREEMPT" and then a date.  Copy down or make note of this information

Go to the page:

https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/commits/master/extra/

it will have a history

Start with the date just before the binary release or the date in the kernel version string.

Or read the string, e.g. there was an update for raspicam, so there is a matching comment.

Click on the link (the comment, e.g. kernel: Bump to...).

Two text files will be there, showing the diff, the rest binary and not displayed.  

You can typically use search - find-in-page on the #nnn value or the date.

If you match the #nnn and the date in uname_string  file (it will be on the far right so you 
will probably have to use the horizontal scrollbar if the find doesn't bring it into view),
the checkout hash will be the value in git_hash of the same color. (red/green are before/after).

If you can't find the string, go back up one to the history and try the next (or every other) 
date down until you find a match.
